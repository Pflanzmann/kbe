## Description

Welcome to my component-based-development project in the Wintersemester 21/22. My goal was to implement a project consisting of various
services representing an online tool to vote for gifs.<br>

The full project includes:

* Application Microservice
* Calculator Service
* Storage Service
* Gateway Service
* Frontend Service

Which can all be found as submodules to this repo.

## Installation and Run

To run the application you have to clone all projects and start it with the following command.

```sh
./gradlew bootRun
```

If you want to run the application service in the debug mode you can use the following:

```sh
./gradlew bootRun --args='--feature.debug=true' 
```

If you start the application in debug mode the application will not do an external api call, instead it will mock it.<br>

The frontend requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run. <br>

```sh
cd <projektfolder>
npm install
```

To start the server

```sh
npm start
```

And open the app in your favourite browser (we recommend [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/download/thanks/))
via ```localhost:3000 ```.
